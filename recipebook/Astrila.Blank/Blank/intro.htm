This algorithm satiesfies following conditions:
After synchrnization cycle between all endpoints finishes, they all save exactly the same data. Let endpoints A, B and C each have a data rows Da, Db and Dc. When A and B synchrinizes then let Db is choosen as row to keep and Da as discarded as an outdated row for both the endpoints. Then when B and C synchrinizes then let Dc is choosen as row to keep and Db as discarded as an outdated row for both the endpoints. Then when A and C synchrinizes then Dc is choosen as row to keep and Da as discarded as an outdated row for both the endpoints.
